                <h3>11. ARBITRATION POLICY</h3>
                <p>
                Users of this web portal acknowledge the web portal arbitration
                policy wherein if there is a disagreement between the buyer and
                seller of a vehicle, and a complaint is made, the buyer and
                seller shall participate in binding arbitration in accordance
                with the terms and conditions set out herein. The parties agree
                that they will sign such further and other documents that may be
                required to affect the said arbitration. If a dealer refuses to
                participate in binding arbitration the web portal has the right
                to terminate the user&acute;s continued use of the web portal<br>
                The auction feature on the web portal requires that all parties
                act reasonably. Integrity of the system is based upon honest
                dealings between involved dealers both buyers and sellers. The
                web portal expects honest and fair dealings between parties to
                be the standard to be maintained in each business transaction. <br>
                Any dealership, which intentionally sets out to deceive or
                defraud others, or to use deceptive tactics, may be suspended or
                permanently banned from the web portal. Upon removal from the
                web portal, appropriate notification will be sent immediately to
                other members setting out that the user has been suspended in
                accordance with the web portals suspension policy. <br>
                Dealer members are expected to thoroughly familiarize themselves
                with our many legal policies and terms and conditions of use.
                This Arbitration Policy is set out to assist the parties with
                legitimate disputes between members. The arbitration policy
                shall not be used in any way to negotiate for reduced price or
                discounts. Buyers are purchasing used vehicles which may or may
                not have imperfections and or problems and which have been
                exposed to certain levels of wear and tear during the
                vehicles&acute; lifespan.

                <h3>12. ARBITRATION</h3>
                <p>
                a) Arbitration is not available until the buyer has paid for the
                vehicle in question in full without any deduction or discount. <br>
                b) Once the vehicle has been received by the buyer from the
                seller, if the buyer wishes to proceed thought arbitration, the
                buyer must complete and forward a complaint and arbitration
                application immediately which begins the process for
                arbitration. The form must be submitted within 7 days of receipt
                of the vehicle otherwise the web portal may not proceed with the
                arbitration process. <br> c) Once the complaint and
                arbitration application is submitted to the web portal, same
                will be acknowledged by the web portal arbitration committee and
                the buyer will have 2 days to provide further information
                including but not limited to mechanical reports, list of
                defects, misrepresentation reports or any other document so that
                the seller and the web portal may properly evaluate the
                complaint. <br> d) The seller will immediately be notified
                about the complaint. At the same time each party will be
                required to execute the web portal&acute;s mandatory arbitration
                policy forms requiring each party to adhere to the precise terms
                and conditions of binding arbitration. If either party refuses
                to sign the required forms, that party is deemed to opt out of
                the arbitration process and may be removed as a member of the
                web portal. <br> e) The seller shall have 3 days or such
                other time that is reasonable in the circumstances to reply to
                the complaint. <br> f) All decisions by the arbitration
                committee is final and binding on both buyer and seller. By
                choosing to initiate the arbitration process, the buyer is
                agreeing to be bound by the arbitrator&acute;s decision. <br>
                g) Arbitration decisions may include cancelling the sale and
                provide a full refund of the purchase price together with
                applicable taxes. Other decisions may include a rebate of the
                purchase price or no action at all and requiring the complaining
                member to make payment for reasonable costs of responding to the
                arbitration proceedings. <br> h) A $200 non refundable
                arbitration initiation fee will be payable by the complaining
                party when the buyer first makes application for arbitration. If
                the complaint is justified the seller may be required to
                reimburse the buyer for the $200 arbitration initiation fee.
